# Data Histories
This repository attempts to reconstruct various bioinformatics data histories
using crowdsourced data sets, to create new version controlled data sets that
can be examined over time.

# Why?
When working with older published data sets, the lack of historical data access
makes it extremely difficult to reproduce the analysis, verify data, or update
results to modern annotations. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to
estimate how rigorous or reproducble a dataset is!
